like pre-rendering blog posts and nav links,\npre-fetching your profile image and adding a bunch of common meta tags.\nHow to get started\nTo create a new Zola site, first download the CLI and install it on your system.\nYou can find installation instructions on the Zola website.\n\n\nAfter you've installed the Zola CLI, run the following command to create a new site:\nzola init my_amazing_site\ncd my_amazing_site\n\n\n\nAfter you've created the site, install the \"Simple Dev Blog\" theme like so:\ngit clone --depth=1 \\\n  https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter \\\n  themes/simple-dev-blog\n\n\n\nNow in your config.toml file, choose the theme by setting theme = \"simple-dev-blog\".\n\n\nThat's it! Now build your site by running the following command, and navigate to 127.0.0.1:111:\nzola serve\n\n\n\nYou should now have a speedy simple dev blog up and running, have fun!\nDeployment\nNetlify is a

lancache\n\n\n\nlancache フォルダの .env をエディターで開いて編集します。今回は vim で編集します。\ncd lancache\nvim .env\n\n\n\nMore Detail を参考に .env を編集します。\n\nLANCACHE_IP: LanCache.NET の IP アドレスです。通常はホストマシンの IP アドレスを設定します。\nDNS_BIND_IP: DNSコンテナの IP アドレスです。LANCACHE_IP と同じ値を設定します。\nUPSTREAM_DNS: 上流の DNS サーバーです。複数のアップストリーム DNS サーバーをセミコロン (またはスペース) で区切って設定できます。\nCACHE_ROOT: キャッシュデータを保存する場所です。\nCACHE_DISK_SIZE: キャッシュするボリュームのサイズです。\nTZ: Docker コンテナのタイムゾーンです。日本にする場合は Asia/Tokyo を設定します。\n\n\n\n次のコマンドで LanCache.NET(lancache-dns, monolithic) を起動します。\nsudo docker-compose up -d\n\nLanCache.NET を終了する場合は次のコマンドを実行します。\nsudo docker-compose down\n\n\n\nルーター\nDNS ポイズニングを行うために lancache-dns の IP アドレスを渡すようにルーターを設定します。\nルーターによって設定方法は異なりますが、多くの場合は LAN 設定から DNS サーバーの IP を変更することができます。\n詳細は公式ドキュメントの Configuring your firewall を参照してください。\n今回はクライアント側で DNS 設定を変更するためこの手順はスキップします。\nクライアントマシン\nDNS を lancache-dns の IP アドレスに設定します。\n\n\n設定画面を開きます。\n\n\nサイドメニューの「ネットワークとインターネット」から「イーサーネット」を開きます。\n\n\n「DNS
